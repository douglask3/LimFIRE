What limits fire where and when: limitations and sensitivity on fire frequency

Global fire models typically simulate fire through representation of fuel load, moisture, natural and anthropogenic ignitions, and land use suppression. A lack of information on the temporal or spatial distribution of these controls has meant that simulation of their relative contributions are largely untested. Therefore the representation of the processes leading to burnt area in fire models is highly uncertain. Despite this, the assumption that burnt area is proportional to the number of fire starts, particularly those started by people, has become pervasive throughout much of the fire modeling community with many models showing significant increases in burnt area with human ignitions.

Here, we map the limitation and sensitivity of burnt area to each control using a simple fire limitation framework. Simple modelled representations of limitations imposed by fuel discontinuity; fuel moisture and atmospheric drying potential; lightning and human ignitions; and land use change on burning are optimized against Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) burnt area observations. The framework uses remotely sensed and meteorological observations.

Fuel moisture is shown to be the main limitation of fire over much of the world, (xx % weighted average, even during local dry seasons), particularly in the humid tropical rainforests and cold, slow drying boreal areas. Fuel discontinuity is the next limitation (xx % annually and xx % in the dry season) especially in deserts, but also extending into grassland areas during the dry season. This is followed by land use change (xx %) and then ignitions (xx %), which is only a significant limiting factor in dry season savannah, where rapid drying of fuel built up during the wet season removes all other natural limitations. In these area, changes in burnt area are actually more sensitive to other controls, typically land use.

This study has a number of controversial results with major implications for process assessment and direction of fire model development. As ignitions only have an impact on burnt area over a limited geographic extent, more effort should instead be directed into correct simulation of fuel loads and moisture. Human ignitions only contribute to a small increase in fire (x %), which is completely offset by the much larger impact of suppression through anthropogenic land cover change. Land use suppression removes almost all fire from the Indian Subcontinent and south-eastern Australia  – where fire models typically over-estimate burning even when including agricultural suppression. The assumption that humans cause fire over much of the world is therefore clearly incorrect, and adequate simulation of suppression through land use should become a priority.  This result also has implications when considering ecosystem services of agricultural land.
