What limits fire where and when: limitations and sensitivity on fire frequency

Global fire models typically simulate fire through representation of fuel load, fuel moisture, natural and anthropogenic ignitions, and land use suppression (see fireMIP).  A lack of information on the temporal or spatial distribution of these factors has meant that the simulated relative contribution of these controls are largely untested. Therefore the representation of the processes leading to burnt area in fire models uncertain. Despite this, the assumption that burnt area is directly proportional to the number of fire starts, particularly those started by people, has become pervasive throughout much of the fire modeling community with many model demonstrating significant increases in burnt area with the introduction of human ignitions.

Here, we map the limitation and sensitivity of burnt area to each control using a simple “fire limitation” framework. Simple modelled representations of limitations imposed by fuel discontinuity; fuel moisture and atmospheric drying potential; lightning and human ignitions; and land use change on burning are optimized against Global Fire Emissions Database )(GFED) burnt area observations. The framework uses remotely sensed and meterlogiocal observations.

Fuel moisture is shown to be the main limitation of fire over much of the world, (xx % weighted average, even during the local dry season), particularly in the humid tropical rainforests and cold, slow drying boreal areas. Fuel discontinuity is the next main limitation (xx % annually and xx % in the dry season) especially in deserts, but also extending into grassland areas during the dry season. This is followed by land use change (xx %) and then ignitions (xx %), which is only a significant limiting factor in savannah and dry woodland, were seasonal build up and rapid drying of fuel removes all other natural limitations. This study has a number of controversial results such as human ignitions only contribute to a small increase in fire (%), which is completely offset by the much larger impact of suppression through anthropogenic land cover change everywhere except a small region of north-eastern Australia. In areas where ignitions are a limiting factor, changes in burnt area are actually more sensitive to other controls, typically land use. Land use suppression removes almost all fire from the Indian Subcontinent and south-eastern Australia  – areas where fire models typically over-estimate burning even when including agricultural suppression, suggesting land use is inadequately represented. 

These findings have major implications for assessing the processes behind simulation of fire regimes, and the direction of future fire model development. As ignitions only have an impact on burnt area over a limited geographic extent, more effort should instead be directed into correct simulation of fuel loads and moisture. The assumption that humans causes much of the worlds fire is also clearly incorrect, and adequate simulation of suppression through land use should become a priority. This result may have implications when considering ecosystem services of agricultural land.
