Aim

Almost all global fire models attempt to simulate fire through fuel load, fuel moisture dynamics, natural and anthropagenic ignitions, and land use supression (see fireMIP). The relative condtribution of each of these controls and fire have remained largely un-evaluated. Here, we test the relative contributions of each of these controls, focussing specifically on the role of humans in influencing fire frequency.

We test the widely assumed dependence of fire frequency on ignition rates – particularly human igntions – found in many 
Not just DGVMS – gneral assumption that ignitions are important
 are evidently incorrect.

Methods
	Using a mix of remote sensed observations and simple contained models, we determine the burnt area through limiations on fire: fuel disconity (fAPAR/??MODIS NPP??); moisture (atomospheric drying power, precip and live-fuel moisture); ignitions (natural via lightning flash count, and athropagenic via population density and pasture cover); and anthropgenic land use supression (popdens and cropland). This simple limiatation model is optimised against GFED observations.

Results
Charicterise areas into limited/co-limited by fuel, moisture, ignitions and land use suppression
Ignitions are shown to be limiting only areas of high fire frequancy such as tropical savvanh and grassland, as a result of lack of other limitations
In these areas, human ignitions only contribute a small fraction of fire (%), and is completely offset by supression through anthrogenic land cover change everywhere except NE Aus.
Despite being limited by igntions, these areas are relatively insesative to changes in igntions, generally sensative to land use change/
Key areas of weakness in many DGVMS (over burning in southern Aus, India) are areas with very high land use supression

Main Conclusions
This demonstrates that, although human igntions have a small but signifcant impact on burnt area over a limited geographic extent, that this shouldnt impact burnt area. But it does!
