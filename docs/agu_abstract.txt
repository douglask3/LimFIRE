What limits fire where: limitations and senativvity on fire frequency
Authors: Douglas Kelley, Ioannis Bistinas, Rhys Whitley, and a couple of others.


Global fire models typically simulate fire through representation of fuel load, fuel moisture, natural and anthropogenic ignitions, and land use suppression (see fireMIP).  A lack of information on their temporal or spatial distribution has meant that the simulated relative contribution of these controls remains untested, and therefore the representation of the processes leading to burnt area in fire models uncertain. Despite this, the assumption that burnt area is directly proportional to the number of fire starts, particularly those by people, has become pervasive throughout much of the fire modelling community.

Here, we map the limitation and sensitivity of fire frequency to each control by optimizing remote sensed, meteorological and simple modelled representations of each fire control against GFED burnt area observations using “fire limitation” framework. <<how the framework works>>.

Fuel moisture is shown to be the main limitation of fire over much of the world, (% weighted average even during local dry season), particularly in the humid tropical rainforests and cold, slow drying boreal areas. Fuel is the next main limitation (% annually and % in the dry season) especially in deserts, but also extending into grassland areas during thre dry season. These are followed by land use change (%) and then ignitions, which is only the limiting factor in savanna and dry woodland, were seasonal build up and rapid drying of fuel removed all other limitation. Human ignitions only contribute a small fraction of fire (%), and is completely offset by suppression through anthropogenic land cover change everywhere except a small region of north-eastern Australia. In areas where ignitions are a limiting factor, changes in fire frequency are actually more sensitive to other controls, typically land use suppression. <<explain>>.

Key areas of weakness in many DGVMS (over burning in southern Aus, India) are areas with very high land use supression

Main Conclusions
This demonstrates that, although human igntions have a small but signifcant impact on burnt area over a limited geographic extent, that this shouldnt impact burnt area. But it does!
















Aims
We test the widely assumed dependence of fire frequency on ignition rates – particularly human igntions – found in many
Not just DGVMS – gneral assumption that ignitions are important
 are evidently incorrect.


Methods
	Using a mix of remote sensed observations and simple contained models, we determine the burnt area through limiations on fire: fuel disconity (fAPAR/??MODIS NPP??); moisture (atomospheric drying power, precip and live-fuel moisture); ignitions (natural via lightning flash count, and athropagenic via population density and pasture cover); and anthropgenic land use supression (popdens and cropland). This simple limiatation model is optimised against GFED observations.
