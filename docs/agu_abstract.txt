Global fire models normally attempt to simulate fire through representation of fuel load, fuel moisture dynamics, natural and anthropagenic ignitions, and land use supression processes (see fireMIP). However, a lack of information on their temporal or spatial distribution has meant that simulated relative contribution of these controls are often left un-evaluated, and therefore the representation of the processes leading to burnt area uncertain. Here, we optimize remote sensed, meteorological and simple modelled representations of each fire control against GFED burnt area observations using “fire limitation” framework, and use to map limitation and sensitivity of fire frequency to each control. 


Over most of the world, fire frequancy is limited by fuel (desert and dry grassland areas) or moisture (forested areas, particularly in tropical rainforests). However, outside of these areas, fire frequancy is limited by anthropagenic land supression and avaiable igntions. Ignitions are only limiting in areas of high fire frequency such as tropical savannah and grassland, where seasonal moisture avaibbility rsult in productuion of abundant fuel loads, which dry out … . 

In these areas, human ignitions only contribute a small fraction of fire (%), and is completely offset by supression through anthrogenic land cover change everywhere except NE Aus.

Despite being limited by igntions, these areas are relatively insesative to changes in igntions, generally sensative to land use change/

Key areas of weakness in many DGVMS (over burning in southern Aus, India) are areas with very high land use supression

Main Conclusions
This demonstrates that, although human igntions have a small but signifcant impact on burnt area over a limited geographic extent, that this shouldnt impact burnt area. But it does!


Aims
We test the widely assumed dependence of fire frequency on ignition rates – particularly human igntions – found in many 
Not just DGVMS – gneral assumption that ignitions are important
 are evidently incorrect. 


Methods
	Using a mix of remote sensed observations and simple contained models, we determine the burnt area through limiations on fire: fuel disconity (fAPAR/??MODIS NPP??); moisture (atomospheric drying power, precip and live-fuel moisture); ignitions (natural via lightning flash count, and athropagenic via population density and pasture cover); and anthropgenic land use supression (popdens and cropland). This simple limiatation model is optimised against GFED observations.
