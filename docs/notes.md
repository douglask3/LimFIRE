# Lit Review stuff
## Bistinas et al.: 

- NPP biggest "fuel" type predictor
- alpha biggest live moisture predictor
- atmopsheric drying variables biggest indicator of dead fuel moisture
- cropland and grzing have roughly equal contribution, so would expect A in term to be ~= 1
- Pasture should have positive affect
- This techinque seperates out control groups to assess specific limitations, not possible with GLM (check).
- Influances on limitations (i.e, crop + urban etc) are linearly combined, before being combined using the relavent function, as per Bistinas et al.
