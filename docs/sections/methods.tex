\section{Methods}
The framework calculates burnt area based on the maximum allowed burnt area from limitations imposed by four controls: fuel, moisture, ignition, and anthropogenic suppression. These controls are described from remote sensed and meteorological observations. Parameters relating controls to fire are optimised against Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED4s) burnt area observations \citep{Giglio2013}.
The framework could probably be used on a range of temporal and spatial resolutions
\hlb{(scale dependency might be something to test in the future?)}.
Here, burnt area is calculated monthly on a 0.5$^{\circ}$ CRUTS3.22 grid \citep{harris2014cru}, between Jan 2000 and Dec 2010 (the period of data overlap).
