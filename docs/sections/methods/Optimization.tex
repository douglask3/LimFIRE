\subsection{Optimization}

\begin{shaded}
    The framework is optimised against GFED4s observations \citep{Giglio2013}  using normalised least squares in R \citep{rstats}.  This is likely to change, though, so I won't describe it anymore for the moment. GFED4s was re-gridded from 0.25 to a 0.5$^{\circ}$ resolution using ``resample'' in the raster r-package \citep{rraster}.


Optimization is performed on equation ~\ref{equ:LimFIRE} to ~\ref{equ:LimFIRE.x}, 4, 15, 16 and 18 % un-hardcode equations numbers
(figure ~\ref{fig:lim_lines}). Each control optimizes two parameters associated with it's maximum expected burnt area (equations ~\ref{equ:fx} and ~\ref{equ:LimFIRE.x}, see figure ~\ref{fig:Logistic_fun}).
Parameters relating different fuel moisture, ignition and suppression sources are also optimized (see table ~\ref{tab:optimize})
\end{shaded}
